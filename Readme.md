# 1st December- Task

# Task1 : Create a script to generate Fibonacci series. User will enter the number and we have to generate series.
# 1. Function based approach
#   Time complexity : O(N) (loop n time )
#   Space complexity : O(1) (no mamory occupie)

# 2. Class based approach
#   Time complexity : O(N) (loop n time )
#   Space complexity : O(1) (no mamory occupie)

# 3. Make sure to comment time and space complexity
